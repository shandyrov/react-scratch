* ```webpack.dev.config.js``` - Development configuration
* ```webpack.prod.config.js``` - Production configuration

## Install Dependencies

```js
npm install
```

## Development

Runs the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:9000 to view it in the browser.

```js
npm run dev
```

## Build

Builds the app for production to the build folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

```js
npm run build
```
